<p> The Password Security Toolkit is a lightweight yet powerful cybersecurity utility designed to analyze, evaluate, and improve password strength. This project is built with a security-first mindset and focuses on helping users understand how strong their passwords really are and how they can be made more secure against modern attack techniques. This toolkit is especially useful for students, beginners in cybersecurity, and ethical hacking enthusiasts who want hands-on experience with password security concepts such as entropy, hashing, brute-force resistance, and common password vulnerabilities.
