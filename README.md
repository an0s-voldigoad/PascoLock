    <h1>🔐 PascoLock Guide</h1>
<p> The Password Security Toolkit is a lightweight yet powerful cybersecurity utility designed to analyze, evaluate, and improve password strength. This project is built with a security-first mindset and focuses on helping users understand how strong their passwords really are and how they can be made more secure against modern attack techniques. This toolkit is especially useful for students, beginners in cybersecurity, and ethical hacking enthusiasts who want hands-on experience with password security concepts such as entropy, hashing, brute-force resistance, and common password vulnerabilities. </p>
    
## 🚀 Features
- Password strength analysis: Evaluates passwords based on length, complexity, character diversity, and predictability.
- Entropy calculation: Measures how resistant a password is to brute-force attacks using mathematical entropy.
- Secure password hashing: Demonstrates secure password hashing using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., SHA-256).
- Common password detection: Checks whether a password exists in commonly used or leaked password lists.
- Colorful CLI interface: Clean and colorful command-line interface designed for Linux environments like Kali Linux.
- Offline functionality: Core features work completely offline, making it fast and privacy-friendly.

## 🗣️ NOTE
This tool is made for beginner friendly and its in it testing/beta stage. Some of its root files may or maynot work such as <code>gui.py</code> which runs a GUI which runs a gui using tkinter may have issue in running. 
- HIBP which checks breaches of your password needs an internet connection to run properly
